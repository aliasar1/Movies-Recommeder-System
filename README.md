## Introduction

The Movie Recommender System is a Python-based notebook that leverages natural language processing techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. It utilizes a dataset of movie titles and their associated descriptions along with movies's credits to generate recommendations using cosine similarity.

## Installation

To run the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aliasar1/Movies-Recommeder-System.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage

1. Open the `Movies Recommender System.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell.
3. Customize the notebook by modifying parameters, datasets, or the recommendation algorithm to fit your requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie titles and their descriptions along with its credits. The data is typically stored in a CSV file and can be customized to include additional fields if desired.

## Approach

The movie recommender system follows the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The movie dataset is preprocessed to remove unnecessary characters, convert text to lowercase, and remove stop words.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical features using CountVectorizer, which creates a matrix of token counts for each movie description.
3. **Text Normalization**: The PorterStemmer algorithm is applied to normalize the features by reducing words to their base or root form.
4. **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine similarity metric is used to calculate the similarity between the feature vectors of each movie. The movies with the highest cosine similarity scores are recommended.

## Results

The movie recommender system generates a list of top 5 recommended movies based on user preferences. The recommendations are presented in descending order of similarity scores, with the most similar movies appearing at the top of the list.

## Future Enhancements

Here are a few potential enhancements that can be made to improve the movie recommender system:

- Implement a collaborative filtering approach to incorporate user ratings and preferences.
- Explore other text preprocessing techniques or algorithms to improve the quality of recommendations.
- Incorporate additional metadata such as genres, actors, and release dates for more accurate recommendations.
- Develop a user interface to provide a user-friendly experience for interacting with the recommender system.
